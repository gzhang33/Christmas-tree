## Current Status

### Workflow Status
**Status:** ⚠️ **Not Initialized**

The `workflow_status` object is empty, indicating the workflow has not been started yet.

### Workflow Items Defined
1. **quick-flow** - Quick assessment and setup
   - Status: `pending`
   
2. **implementation** - Implementation tasks
   - Status: `pending`

### Project Structure Analysis
- ✅ Main application file: `App.tsx`
- ✅ Component structure: `components/` directory
- ✅ Type definitions: `types.ts`
- ✅ Configuration: `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`
- ⚠️ Missing component: `components/Experience.tsx` (referenced in App.tsx but deleted)
- ✅ Documentation: `README.md`, `docs/bmm-workflow-status.yaml`

---

## Next Actions

### Immediate Priority: HIGH

**Recommended Action:** Initialize workflow by starting `quick-flow`

**Reason:** According to the brownfield-level-0 workflow path, `quick-flow` is the first workflow item for brownfield level 0 projects and should be executed before implementation tasks.

### Steps to Proceed

1. **Start Quick-Flow Workflow**
   - Run the quick-flow workflow to perform initial assessment
   - This will set up the project baseline and identify any immediate issues

2. **Address Missing Component**
   - The `App.tsx` file imports `Experience` from `./components/Experience`, but this file was deleted
   - Either restore the component or update the import

3. **Initialize Workflow Status**
   - Update `workflow_status` in `docs/bmm-workflow-status.yaml` after completing quick-flow
   - Track progress for each workflow item

---

## Recommendations

### Short-term (Before Implementation)
1. ✅ **Fix Missing Component**
   - Resolve the missing `Experience.tsx` component import issue
   - Ensure the application can run without errors

2. ✅ **Complete Quick-Flow Assessment**
   - Assess current codebase state
   - Document any technical debt or issues
   - Establish baseline metrics

3. ✅ **Update Workflow Status**
   - Mark quick-flow as complete when finished
   - Update status file with progress

### Medium-term (During Implementation)
1. **Run Document-Project Workflow**
   - After quick-flow completion, consider running `document-project` workflow
   - This will create comprehensive reference documentation for AI-assisted development

2. **Track Implementation Progress**
   - Update workflow_status as implementation tasks are completed
   - Maintain clear visibility into project state

### Long-term
1. **Maintain Workflow Status**
   - Regularly update the status file as work progresses
   - Use `/workflow-status` command to check current state

2. **Complete All Workflow Items**
   - Ensure both `quick-flow` and `implementation` are marked complete
   - Document any deviations or custom workflows

## Workflow Path Reference

**Path File:** `bmad/bmm/workflows/workflow-status/paths/brownfield-level-0.yaml`

**Workflow Sequence:**
1. quick-flow (pending)
2. implementation (pending)

---

## Summary

**Current State:** Workflow not initialized - ready to begin  
**Next Step:** Start `quick-flow` workflow  
**Priority:** High  
**Blockers:** Missing `Experience.tsx` component (needs resolution)
